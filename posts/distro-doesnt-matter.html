        <center><p>Recently I have really wanted to use the gnome desktop. I have no idea as to why this is. I just want to. I have also wanted to see what ubuntu is like lately. Plus I really like the look of the ubuntu wallpaper. It also has a good default apparmor setup and comes with ufw installed.

          There are still some down sides to Ubuntu, such as snaps. Which are very annoying when trying to run the `lsblk` command. But to fix this you can just run `lsblk -e 7` and then none of the snaps will show up. To make this even easier I usually just make this an alias in which ever shell I happen to be running at the time. So that would be FISH right now.
