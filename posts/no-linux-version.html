        <center><p>I was playing Clone Drone In The Danger Zone, when I thought that it would be fun to install some mods. I was very then very disappointed to find out that the main client for installing mods, Mod-Bot only works on windows as it is a .exe file. It is also not activley worked and is not longer widley used by anyone but I will use it to make a point in this post.

          Now, I do understand the reasons for this. The first one is that there are not many Clone Drone in the Danger Zone players that use Linux. So why would the devs of the client want to go through the headaches just so a handful of players can mod the game.
          <br>
          <br>
          Another reason for the lack of support is most likely because the actual game itself does not have native Linux support and must be played through a compatibility layer. I use Proton with Steam, as in my opinion it is the most polished.

          So what was the point of me rambling on about the fact that I cannot mod the game I play. It was to make the point that this lack of support is not the fault of Linux. You see lots of people taking a dig at Linux by calling it out for its "lack of support". In my opinion they should not be calling Linux out but in fact calling out developers who do not build in Linux support. Obviously I am not saying you should call out a small developer of a mod launcher, who has spent their free time working on the project for not supporting Linux. But you could kindly request a Linux version.

          So, the point of this post is that people should not be faulting Linux for a lack of support but rather developers or the companies that make the software. Especially the big companies who can definitely afford to build Linux support into their software.
